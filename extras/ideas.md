## Ideas/To-do

### Visual-ish
- [ ] Switch to grid from flex?
- [ ] ~~Move select all etc. to left?~~
- [ ] Hide file choose input with label for
- [ ] Display something when no images are present in the current folder
- [ ] Themes with colour palettes?
- [ ] Makeover to rest of the buttons to make them similar to search/add/remove

### Functional
- [x] Select folder instead of a tree?
- [ ] Remove all tags option for selected
- [ ] Delete database option
- [ ] Back up database option?
  - [ ] Maybe simply open db folder when clicked for manual backup?
- [ ] A separate constant array/dictionary to hold strings
- [ ] Select/Deselect All for tags section
- [ ] Sorting for tags
- [ ] Warn before loading a ton of images?
- [ ] Option to sever ties with broken paths of tagged images
- [ ] Options/About on a pop-out using Electron?
  - [ ] Have them both on the same pop-up with tabbed navigation?
  ### Options
  - [ ] Display tags of the images under them? Maybe a toggle?
  - [ ] Move "Load Errors?" to an options section with the one above?
  - [ ] Deselect after applying tag option?
  - [ ] Save options to a json as well
  - [ ] A setting for search to return AND instead of OR
  - [ ] Radio buttons and save option
