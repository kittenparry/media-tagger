## Ideas/To-do

### Visual-ish
- [ ] ~~Switch to grid from flex?~~
- [ ] ~~Move select all etc. to left?~~
- [ ] Hide file choose input with label for
- [ ] Display something when no images are present in the current folder
  - [ ] "Select tags to filter" when no tags are selected
  - [ ] "No tags exist" when there are no tags
- [ ] Themes with colour palettes?
- [ ] Makeover to rest of the buttons to make them similar to search/add/remove

### General Functional
- [x] Select folder instead of a tree?
- [ ] Remove all tags option for selected images
- [ ] Delete database option
- [ ] Back up database option?
  - [ ] Maybe simply open db folder when clicked for manual backup?
- [ ] A separate constant array/dictionary to hold strings
- [ ] Select/Deselect All for tags section
- [ ] Sorting for tags
- [ ] Warn before loading a ton of images?
- [ ] Option to sever ties with broken paths of tagged images
- [x] Options/About on a pop-out using Electron?
  - [ ] Have them both on the same pop-up with tabbed navigation?
- [ ] Double click image to open with the default viewer?
- [ ] Probably turn some of the CSS into a common file used between windows
- [ ] Catch empty database reading eg. {}

### Options Menu
- [ ] * Display tags of the images under them? Maybe a toggle?
- [ ] * Move "Load Errors?" to an options section with the one above?
- [ ] * Deselect after applying tag option?
- [x] Save options to a json as well
- [ ] A setting for search to return AND instead of OR
- [x] Radio buttons and save option
- [x] Also add options to the menu bar
- [ ] Catch broken settings and give option to reset them

### Bugs
- [ ] Tags display an empty line, presumably for everything tagged
- [ ] Load errors? doesn't work properly
